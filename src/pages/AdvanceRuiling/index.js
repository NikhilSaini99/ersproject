          The ERS issues Advance Rulings in terms of the Customs and Excise Act,
          1971. The practice is also recommended in the WTO Agreement on Trade
          Facilitation (TFA) as a measure through which the administration
          issues binding decisions on the classification, valuation and origin
          of goods. This is for the benefit of a trader (importer, exporter or
          declarants) as they can apply for the Advance Ruling prior to
          importing or exporting the goods and thus have certainty on the
          treatment of the goods on the area / subject covered by the ruling.<br/><br/> To
          apply for an Advance Ruling, an entity must be registered on the â€˜ERS
          Advance Rulings Platform. Please use the link below to register and
          apply.<br/><br/> The platform also allows users to search for and view existing
          Advance Rulings that have been issued by ERS.
