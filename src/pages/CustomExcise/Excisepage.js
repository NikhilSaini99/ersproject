                        In Eswatini, Excise duties are paid on alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, road fuels, cars, TVs, and refrigerators. As is the case in the other SACU member states, Excise duties are collected both at import into a SACU country or at the place of domestic manufacture of these items.
