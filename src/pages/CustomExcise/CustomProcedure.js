Part of that information is the Customs Procedure Codes (CPCs) which when correctly used inform the ERS on what the goods are being imported as well as the regime under which Customs will treat it.\n\nAdditional codes are denoted by the last 3-digit code in the 7-digit Customs Procedure Codes (CPC). A complete CPC may be 4000 444 where:\n\n4000 is the extended code; and\n444 is the additional code.\n\nWhen selected, the interpretation would be goods imported for home use (Extended Code 4000) where the VAT payable would be deferred (Additional Code 444).',

A declarant has to note that each procedure and additional code has to be backed by provisions of legislation in Eswatini.\n\nAccordingly the selection of an additional code constitutes an integral part of a declaration to Customs in terms of Section 13 as read with Section 39 of the Customs and Excise Act, 1971 and other applicable legislation.\n\nDeclarants, importers and exporters are therefore advised to familiarize themselves with all provisions of legislation impacting on each CPC and specific additional codes that they select in declaring goods on the SAD 500.\n\nNote: In all Extended Procedures the selection of a general Additional Code 000 denotes that no relief from duties and taxes payable is applicable. That is to say all applicable Customs Duties (unless the goods are admissible Customs duty free) as per the Tariff Handbook and / or VAT are payable upon entry at the port of clearance.
